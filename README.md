 Project since 2016
 Fully recoded version of the emulator with well more documented source and complete different and more modern C# syntax used.
 Server's usage is low, stable & solid.
 
 ###### Current stage: Stable / BETA
 
 ### Coding syntax
 I've simplifed absolutely everything as much as possible and most of the server is dynamic.
 As of now it takes no more than 1 line to add an asset / object / npc or whatsoever to the map.
